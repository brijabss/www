     <h2> The Importance of Supporting Dogs in Shelters</h2>
      <ul><br>
        <li> You save a life, many animals  are in need of a second chance as they have been   lost, given up or abandoned </li>
          <br>
        <li> Adopting from a shelter helps weaken the pet overpopulation cycle; each year 8 to 12 million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens are euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them.</li>
          <br>
        <li> You support a valuable charity and community institution.</li>
          <br>
        <li> You pay less and encourage others to shop at animal shetlers</li>
