       <p> Hi, my name is Brianna Jablonowski!! I have loved dogs since forever and am very passionate about saving their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let me educate you on why you should adopt and not shop!!
        </p>
        <p>
        All of my dogs growing up were shelter rescues and they are the most loving creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
        For my birthday in 8th grade, instead of asking for gifts I asked for money to donate to the animal shelter. I also volunteered at one for awhile so they hold a special place in my heart.
